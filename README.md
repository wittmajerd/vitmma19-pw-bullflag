[Complete the missing parts and delete the instruction parts before uploading.]

## Project Details

### Project Information

- **Selected Topic**: Bull-flag detector
- **Student Name**: Wittmajer Dávid
- **Aiming for +1 Mark**: No

### Solution Description

[Provide a short textual description of the solution here. Explain the problem, the model architecture chosen, the training methodology, and the results.]


### Docker Instructions

This project is containerized using Docker. Follow the instructions below to build and run the solution.
[Adjust the commands that show how do build your container and run it with log output.]

#### Build

Run the following command in the root directory of the repository to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t dl-project .
```

#### Run

To run the solution, use the following command. You must mount your local data directory to `/app/data` inside the container.

**To capture the logs for submission (required), redirect the output to a file:**

```bash
docker run -v /absolute/path/to/your/local/data:/app/data dl-project > log/run.log 2>&1
```

*   Replace `/absolute/path/to/your/local/data` with the actual path to your dataset on your host machine that meets the [Data preparation requirements](#data-preparation).
*   The `> log/run.log 2>&1` part ensures that all output (standard output and errors) is saved to `log/run.log`.
*   The container is configured to run every step (data preprocessing, training, evaluation, inference).


### File Structure and Functions

[Update according to the final file structure.]

The repository is structured as follows:

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the machine learning pipeline.
    - `01-data-preprocessing.py`: Scripts for loading, cleaning, and preprocessing the raw data.
    - `02-training.py`: The main script for defining the model and executing the training loop.
    - `03-evaluation.py`: Scripts for evaluating the trained model on test data and generating metrics.
    - `config.py`: Configuration file containing hyperparameters (e.g., epochs) and paths.
    - `utils.py`: Helper functions and utilities used across different scripts.

- **`notebook/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for analysis and experimentation.
    - `01-data-exploration.ipynb`: Notebook for initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.
    - `02-label-analysis.ipynb`: Notebook for analyzing the distribution and properties of the target labels.

- **`log/`**: Contains log files.
    - `run.log`: Example log file showing the output of a successful training run.

- **Root Directory**:
    - `Dockerfile`: Configuration file for building the Docker image with the necessary environment and dependencies.
    - `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for the project.
    - `README.md`: Project documentation and instructions.
